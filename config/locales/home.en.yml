    title: "What's Goggles?"
    point_1: "\"Master-Goggles\" (or, more informally, \"Goggles\") stems in between 2012 and 2013 from the hard passion of a couple of mad programmers which, by chance, happen to be also competitive swimmers (or, maybe, it's the other way around)."
    point_2: "It's basically a collection of Masters' Swimming meeting results either from National & Regional Championships, gathered from different sources, with a little help from its users. Although not limited to those, it's currently focus are any Italian Master Swimming results published online and whatnot."
    point_3: "We don't have a commercial agenda: we just wanted a cozy place where we could browse our swimming results. ...And, frankly put, most \"official\" sites often aren't like what we wished for."
    point_4: "It's totally self-sponsored and totally free for its users. (But you can contribute, in case you want.)"
    point_5: "It's Open-Source, on LGPL License (see below)."

  how_does_it_work:
    title: 'How does it work?'
    point_1: "Goggles' users data is a separate thing from the \"actual\" swimmers found inside the meeting results because these come from different data sources: the swimmers anagraphical data is published by Federations or individual Teams, whereas each single registered user provides us just an e-mail address, the full name and the year of birth."
    point_2: "Goggles then tries to establish a link between the user name & year of birth with the swimmers data from the available Master Swimmers Meeting results (not always successfully, but it can be edited in case of a mismatch or any other issue)."
    point_3: "Having a link between the user and a swimmer among the results is not required and it's just a shortcut for displaying easily a dashboard with all the user's stats and the corresponding events; but having a registered user will allow you also to browse through the performance statistics of all other swimmers & teams as well."
    point_4: "As said above, Goggles currently is very focused on the Italian Master Swimmer scene - but nothing so far prevents us from expanding it in the future. In between 2013 and 2019, Goggles has indexed almost all swimming result data from the National FIN Master Championship in Italy, as well the Regional CSI Championship for Emilia Romagna, but - sadly - just a handful of results from the UISP Master, the LEN Master and the FINA Master Championships."
    point_5: "Even if your swimming results aren't here, you, or your Team Coach, can always queue them for registration using the integrated \"Chrono\" app or any of the available edit links you may find scattered around the meeting pages."

  who_we_are:
    title: 'Who we are:'
    point_1: "Stefano <i>(Steve)</i> Alloro & Marco <i>(Leega)</i> Ligabue, \"senior\" master swimmers, originally enlisted within the \"C.S.I. Ober Ferrari\" Team, from Reggio Emilia, Italy. Since a handful of years only Steve (which is me) is actually maintaining Goggles, so don't bother asking Leega pointless questions as he'll surely reply \"Ask that to Steve\"."

  contributing:
    title: 'How can I contribute?'
    point_1: "Send us your swimming results or even the single lap timings either creating a specific request from the \"Issues?\" page, or by using the integrated \"Chrono\" application, if your user has been registered and accepted as a 'Team Manager'."
    point_2: "Developing or fixing the source code (through Pull-requests). You can start from here and head on to the WiKi for more information:"
    point_3: "Sponsoring the hosting of this project, even with tiny amounts:"

  faq:
    title: 'F.A.Q.'
    q_1: "Hey! Where did <i>[insert your favorite legacy feature here]</i> ended up? Why I cannot find that anymore?"
    a_1: "Goggles v7+ is a complete rewrite and many features that were consolidated in the previous versions are yet to be developed. We aim to reintroduce them all (mostly), eventually & step by step."
    q_2: "I'd like to report an issue but the system forces me to be signed-up and logged, why?"
    a_2: "There's a whole dedicated FAQ section regarding how to report issues, but this requires user identification in order to prevent any kind of spamming. <i>(Afterall, there's a poor human being at the other side of this thing reading all your requests, so it's better to have his little precious time well distributed among all.)</i>"
    q_3: "Showing the results from a certain meeting sometimes takes so much time I really wanna curse. I mean... Can't you do something about it?"
    a_3: "Beside the obvious \"I'm working on it\" and \"Patience is a virtue\", be advised that Goggles runs on a *very* entry-level machine, it's self-managed, self-financed and self-maintened by a single gerbil running on a minature threadmill (which is me, Steve). So if the meeting result page you're trying to get to is somehow popular at the moment or has a lot of results in it, the tiny server may be crying for overwork in any case. Future updates will surely try to improve the speed of each page, but keep in mind the context and be possibly comprehensive."
    q_4: "Where do Goggles takes its data from? How reliable are they?"
    a_4: "For the *official* results, as already written elsewhere, always check the official websites of any Federation involved in a meeting.<br/>Regarding Goggles, its main source for the data is the Event Calendar published by the Italian Swimming Federation (FIN). Data can also come from user contributions but, most of the times, it's imported directly from PDFs published by the organizers of the event when they become available. Data is converted, adapted, <i>manually</i> checked (sampling some events) and only then imported so that it can be aggregated with all other results."
    a_4b: "The PDF reports (or any other data published on a site) may have mistakes, typos or incoherences in them. Then again, the conversion process may introduce some issues as well so don't treat the data shown here as error-free. To report any inconsistency, click on the 'üö©' or 'üè¥' buttons that appear on each event page.<br/>Refer to the 'Issues?' page for more details."
    q_5: "What do I do if I see my results have been wrongly aggregated by homonymy with another same-named swimmer or by mistake?"
    a_5: "In order to separate data from two or more swimmers with the same name, gender and year of birth without knowing the swimmer's badge code (which is 'almost never' printed out on the meeting results reports), we need to know in which Teams the swimmer was registered to - and, possibly, in which year(s). It's really improbable that two swimmers having same name, gender and year of birth will be registered to the same team. Whenever that may happen, usually the Federations add a number or a code to the results to help discriminate between homonyms. If you incur in this problem, contact us directly through the 'Issues?' page."
    q_6: "How come in the 'Latest data updates' section above sometimes very old Meeting results pop-up like you're lagging behind hard?"
    a_6: "Whenever we get a new list of results or lap timings for older Meetings from our users or other contributions or corrections, data will be updated as soon as possible. In some cases it may seems Goggles is lagging behind because time is a limited resource and the list of Meeting events to be imported is pretty long and grows constantly. But, possibly, Goggles doesn't loose track of what has happened or has been planned. So it's slowly progressing."
    q_7: "So... Who or what makes you do this? All this work for what? Just tiny little numbers? ...What's your 'business plan' here?"
    a_7: "\"<i>I</i> make myself do it.\" As already written, there's no damn 'business plan' behind Goggles, which is self-financed and self-managed. We just wanted a better way to record and aggregate all our swimming life data without too much fuss. If you like it, good. If you don't, the Internet is big enough to for you to find your own green meadow to cultivate yourself - and have a good life."
