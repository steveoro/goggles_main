    title: 'Goggles!'
    point_1: "\"Master-Goggles\" (or, more informally, \"Goggles\") stems in between 2012 and 2013 from the hard passion of a couple of mad programmers which, by chance, happen to be also competitive swimmers (or, maybe, it's the other way around)."
    point_2: "It's basically a collection of Master Swimming meeting results from National & Regional Championships, gathered from different sources, with a little help from its users."
    point_3: "We don't have a commercial agenda: we just wanted a cozy place where we could browse our swimming results. ...And, frankly put, most \"official\" sites often aren't like what we wished for."
    point_4: "It's totally self-sponsored and totally free for its users. (But you can contribute, in case you want.)"
    point_5: "It's Open-Source, on LGPL License (see below)."

  how_does_it_work:
    title: 'How does it work?'
    point_1: "Goggles' users data is a separate thing from the \"actual\" swimmers found inside the meeting results because these come from different data sources: the swimmers anagraphical data is published by Federations or individual Teams, whereas each single registered user provides us just an e-mail address, the full name and the year of birth."
    point_2: "Goggles then tries to establish a link between the user name & year of birth with the swimmers data from the available Master Swimmers Meeting results (not always successfully, but it can be edited)."
    point_3: "Having a link between the user and a swimmer among the results is not required and it's just a shortcut for displaying easily a dashboard with all the user's stats and the corresponding events, but having a registered user will allow you also to browse through the performance statistics of all other swimmers & teams as well."
    point_4: "Goggles currently is very focused on the Italian Master Swimmer scene - but nothing so far prevents us from expanding it in the future. In between 2013 and 2019, Goggles has indexed almost all swimming result data from the National FIN Master Championship in Italy, as well the Regional CSI Championship for Emilia Romagna, but - sadly - just a handful of results from the UISP Master, the LEN Master and the FINA Master Championships."
    point_5: "Even if your swimming results aren't here, you, or your Team Coach, can always queue them for registration using the integrated \"Chrono\" app."

    q_1: "Hey! Where did <i>[insert your favorite legacy feature here]</i> ended up? Why I cannot find that anymore?"
    a_1: "Goggles v7+ is a complete rewrite and many features that were consolidated in the previous versions are yet to be developed. We aim to reintroduce them all (mostly), eventually & step by step."

    title: "Privacy Policy"
    point_1: "<strong>We don't share with no-one any kind of user data</strong> (e-mail, full name and year of birth)."
    point_2: "The full user name and the year of birth are used internally just to match the current user with any swimmer existing in our database (simply put: <i>\"we can't tell you in which competitions you took part unless we know who you are\"</i>)."
    point_3: "<strong>We don't use any kind of analytical cookies</strong>."
    point_4: "We use session cookies just to store some user preferences during a login session."
    point_5: "<strong>We do not track our users.</strong> Some features of Master-Goggles, like the <i>\"Map of the Meetings near by\"</i> may require you to turn on geo-localization, but that's just if you want to use those features."
